1. Question 1
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

SELECT
  f.title AS film_title, c.name AS category_name, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM
  film f
INNER JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
INNER JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
INNER JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
INNER JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
WHERE
  c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY
  f.title,c.name
ORDER BY
  c.name



2.Question 2
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration 
that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels 
(first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the average rental duration(in the number of days)
 for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

WITH family_categories AS (
  SELECT
    c.name,
    c.category_id
  FROM category c
  WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
  ORDER BY 1
)

SELECT
  f.title,
  fam_cat.name,
  f.rental_duration,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM family_categories fam_cat
JOIN film_category fc ON fc.category_id = fam_cat.category_id
JOIN film f ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3


3.Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of
 movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
Category
Rental length category
Count

SELECT
    tab1.name, tab1.standard_quartile,
    COUNT(tab1.standard_quartile) AS quartile_count
FROM ( SELECT
        f.title,  c.name,  f.rental_duration,
        NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
    FROM   category c
    JOIN
        film_category fc ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
    JOIN
        film f ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
    WHERE
        c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
) tab1
GROUP BY
    tab1.name,  tab1.standard_quartile
ORDER BY
    tab1.name ASC,  tab1.standard_quartile ASC,    quartile_count DESC;



4. We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the
 years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of
 rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: 
year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.


SELECT
    DATE_PART('month', r.rental_date) month_rented,
    DATE_PART('year', r.rental_date) year_rented,
    s.store_id,
    COUNT(*) AS rent_count
FROM
    rental r
    JOIN staff s ON s.staff_id = r.staff_id
    JOIN store st ON st.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY
    1, 2, 3
ORDER BY
    4 DESC;
